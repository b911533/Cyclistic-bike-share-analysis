### Divvy_Exercise_Full_Year_Analysis ###

# This analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study). The purpose of this script is to consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single dataframe and then conduct simple analysis to help answer the key question: “In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?”

#=====================
# STEP 1: COLLECT DATA
#=====================
# Upload Divvy datasets (csv files) here
m6_2022 <- read_csv("/Users/jimchan/googleDAcertificate/case1/data/202206-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m7_2022 <- read_csv("/Users/jimchan/googleDAcertificate/case1/data/202207-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m8_2022 <- read_csv("/Users/jimchan/googleDAcertificate/case1/data/202208-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m5_2022 <- read_csv("/Users/jimchan/googleDAcertificate/case1/data/202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")

#====================================================
# STEP 2: WRANGLE DATA AND COMBINE INTO A SINGLE FILE
#====================================================
# Compare column names each of the files and make sure column names match
colnames(m7_2022)
colnames(m8_2022)
colnames(m6_2022)
colnames(m5_2022)

# Inspect the dataframes and look for incongruencies
str(m5_2022)
str(m8_2022)
str(m7_2022)
str(m6_2022)

# Convert ride_id and rideable_type to character so that they can stack correctly
m8_2022 <-  mutate(m8_2022, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 
m7_2022 <-  mutate(m7_2022, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 
m6_2022 <-  mutate(m6_2022, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 

# Stack individual quarter's data frames into one data frame
all_trips <- bind_rows(m6_2022, m7_2022, m8_2022, m5_2022)

# Remove lat, long, birthyear, and gender fields as this data was dropped beginning in 2020
all_trips <- all_trips %>%  
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))

#======================================================
# STEP 3: CLEAN UP AND ADD DATA TO PREPARE FOR ANALYSIS
#======================================================
# Inspect the new table that has been created
colnames(all_trips)  #List of column names
nrow(all_trips)  #How many rows are in data frame?
dim(all_trips)  #Dimensions of the data frame?
head(all_trips)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame.  Also tail(all_trips)
str(all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips)  #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics

# observations fall under each usertype
table(all_trips$member_casual)

# Add columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride
# Aggregate ride data for each month, day, or year ... before completing these operations we could only aggregate at the ride level
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")

# Add a "ride_length" calculation to all_trips (in seconds)
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at)

# Inspect the structure of the columns
str(all_trips)

# Convert "ride_length" from Factor to numeric so we can run calculations on the data
is.factor(all_trips$ride_length)
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))
is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)

# Removing unusual data
# rows with ride_length that was negative
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[-all_trips$ride_length<0,]

#=====================================
# STEP 4: CONDUCT DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
#=====================================
# Descriptive analysis on ride_length (all figures in seconds)
mean(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #straight average (total ride length / rides)
median(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #midpoint number in the ascending array of ride lengths
max(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #longest ride
min(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #shortest ride

# statistics about the ride_length
summary(all_trips$ride_length)

# Compare members and casual users
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)

# average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

# fix the days of the week in order
all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

# compute average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

# analyze ridership data by type and weekday
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)								# sorts

# visualize the number of rides by rider type
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

# visualization for average duration
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

#=================================================
# STEP 5: EXPORT SUMMARY FILE FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS
#=================================================
# Create a csv file that we will visualize in Excel, Tableau, or my presentation software
counts <- aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
write.csv(counts, file = '/Users/jimchan/googleDAcertificate/case1/data/avg_ride_length.csv')
